#VFD-RPi

My first attempt to share back some of the code I'm creating for my Raspberry Pi projects.

The python script demonstrates writing text to the VFD and includes details on wiring in the comments.

The exact model of VFD this applies to is IEE 36199-01 (stamped on the back) and the datasheet for it is miraculously still here (http://docs.bgmicro.com/pdf/acs1375.pdf) even though I bought the thing at surplus over 15 years ago. The datasheet is pretty complete except that it doesn't have the addresses of the first character positions. I detrermined those by some guesswork, as the second line differs a bit from standard HD44780 addressing.

If this helps you let me know.
